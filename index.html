        <p>Here you can find some information about my favorite artist : Austin Patten</p>

        <p>I really like his songs, as they have a smooth rythm on them and can uplift a mood!</p>
        <p>I have known this artist since they were at 300 subscribers, its been good to see them grow from Beat-production to rap.</p>
